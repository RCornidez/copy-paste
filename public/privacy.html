    <h1>Privacy Policy of Copy/Paste Application</h1>
    <p>At Copy/Paste, we are dedicated to safeguarding your privacy.</p>
    <p>To enhance security and prevent malicious activities, we utilize CloudFlare as a URL proxy and SSL certificate provider. CloudFlare monitors access for high-level analytics, primarily to understand geographic access patterns.</p>
    <p><strong>Information Retention:</strong> The only data directly retained by Copy/Paste is WebRTC signal data, crucial for device connection setup. Post-session, this data is promptly removed from our signaling server.</p>
    <To><strong>Data Transmission Security:</strong> Text and files transmitted via Copy/Paste are strictly accessible by two devices - the session initiator and the joining device. To delve deeper into WebRTC and its security aspects, we recommend this insightful article: <a href="https://webrtc-security.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Study of WebRTC Security</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Copy/Paste is not liable for the content of data transmissions. Please exercise discretion and legality in your transmissions. As this is a public utility tool, avoid sharing sensitive information. For enhanced privacy, consider hosting a private version behind a firewall or VPN. Access our source code on <a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p>
